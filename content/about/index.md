I am currently a PhD Student at the University of Utah studying image processing and computer vision in [Dr. Tolga Tasdizen's](http://www.sci.utah.edu/~tolga/) lab. 

I graduated with a BS in Mathematics and Statistics from Utah State University in 2019. Then I graduated with an MS in Computing, focusing on data science from The University of Utah in 2022. 

My current research is on uncertainty quantification in convolutional neural nets. I am especially interested in the crossover of mathematics, statistics, and computer science. Some other non-research interests are Linux, homelab system administration, and security. 

I also love cycling in the summer and skiing in the winter. 

## Research Interests
- Image Processing
- Computer Vision
- Uncertainty Quantification

## Projects
- [Semi-supervised Image Segmentation](https://github.com/jakobottar/gimondi) - My Masters project, focusing on improving the accuracy of a segmentation U-Net architecture utilizing unlabeled data. 
- [PL Season Explorer](https://jakobottar.github.io/pl-season-explorer/) - A class project, visualizing the 2020 Premier League season stats on the web using [D3.js](https://d3js.org/).
